PRODUCER PERFORMANCE

Number of Records (Constant): 1,000,000,000

Record Size (Variable):

Acknowedgment Level (Variable):

Buffer Memory (Variable) (bytes):
https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/producer-configs.html#buffer.memory

Batch Size (Variable) (bytes): The maximum amount of data that can be sent in a single request.
https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/configuration/producer-configs.html#batch.size

The producer config property batch.size defaults to 16K bytes. This is used by the Producer to batch records.
This setting enables fewer requests and allows multiple records to be sent to the same partition.
Use this batch.size setting to improve IO throughput and performance on both producer and server (and consumer).
Using a larger batch.size makes compression more efficient. If a record is larger than the batch size, it will not be batched.
This setting allows the Producer to send requests containing multiple batches. The batches are per partition.
The smaller the batch size the less the throughput and performance.
If the batch size is too big and often gets sent before full, the memory allocated for the batch is wasted.
